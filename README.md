# DIGIT CLASSIFICATION WITH MNIST DATASET USING CNN

> The dataset downloaded from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

In this project, dataset extracted with python code and training applied with matlab code.

* ðŸŒŸ You can call python from matlab, if you want to learn how to do it  you can look at the [document](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/call-python-libraries.html)

## ðŸš€ Run this project on your local computer with MATLAB R2022a

1 - Clone the repo

```$git clone https://github.com/akdenizz/mnist_classification```

2 - Create dataset folder that structure like shown below

3 - Now you can run the train.m file in MATLAB

4 - You can look at the training process, it should open automatically

> You can stop it manually if the training accuracy become constant. 

You can also see it the command window;

5 - After training, you can predict it with your own picture which you can create it on paint with size [28 28] and balck bacground. Because the dataset that you train your network has black background and [28 28 1] size. You can run predict.m and see the result!!
